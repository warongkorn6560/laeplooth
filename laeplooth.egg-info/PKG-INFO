# Laeplooth

Laeplooth is a Python package designed for translating text to Loo language. Inspired by the Thaispoon package, Laeplooth adapts to modern Kratoey logic while preserving the unique nuances of the Loo language. This package aims to facilitate communication by providing translation capabilities.

## Reference

I incorporated the logic presented in the YouTube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s54F7MU-jNI" to enhance the functionality. Special thanks to the creator for sharing their insights and expertise.

## Features

- Translate text to the Loo language.
- Simple and easy-to-use Python API.

## Installation

You can install Laeplooth using pip:
`pip install laeplooth`

## Usage

```
from laeplooth import loo

# Translate text to Loo
loo_text = loo("อีดอก")
print(loo_text) # Output: "หลอกดูก"
```
